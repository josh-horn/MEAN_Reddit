Got to about Get/Topics and such, but have no idea what went wrong and why it doesnt show up anymore after switching the project to an express project. npm start -> preview live project starts the project and shows the GETs, but nothing else. Had to revert back to try and fix things and couldn't. Authentication wasn't finished and trying to route things broke it, so I dropped both of them from the c9.io version.
